# Password-Generator-2

Every website has some form of security interface requiring user authentication. These forms often use your email and password to access the website. Using a secure password when logging in is essential to prevent the bad guys (hackers) from gaining access to your account.


This reposirtory will provide random password generators using Python by generating a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols as characters scrambled together, making it difficult to crack or guess the password.

## Getting Started
To build a random password generator, weâ€™ll use this approach:

Write out all acceptable passwords character types, such as the letters, numbers, and symbols
Give users the ability to enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the generated password
Randomize the order of characters to make it hard to guess
